# Grifin Full Stack Engineer Test Drive
## Purpose
This test drive exercise aims to simulate what it is like to work with the Grifin team in a low-pressure way that closely resembles how we work together in real life. You will get a sense of how our engineers work, and, in turn, we get to understand what it is like to work with you.

## Overview
1. Your interviewer will provide access to this code repo by sending an invitation to the email address associated with your GitHub handle.
2. Once you've gained access to the codebase, please send a confirmation message to the interviewer.
3. Review the [SHAPEUP.md](docs/SHAPEUP.md) file, which contains the detailed specification for the features to implement.
4. **Optional** - Before beginning the coding portion of the test drive, you may schedule a 15-minute Q&A session with the interviewer to clarify any outstanding questions or confirm your understanding of the scope.
5. Once you've completed implementation, create a PR and assign the following users as reviewers: `gregmundy`,  `DillonCC97`, and `Marjan-Ivanovski`.
6. Please send an email to your point of contact letting them know you submitted the test drive code.
7. Your point of contact will schedule a code review session with you and the team to discuss the PR.

## Coding Activity Guideline
The coding activity demonstrates your approach to solving moderately complex real-world problems while allowing you the flexibility to showcase your engineering talent and creativity. We value your time and have placed the following constraints on this project to help focus your time:
1. **Don't start from scratch**. Use the project created in this repository as your starting point.
2. **Limit your coding activity to 4 hours**. We don't strictly enforce this time limit; however, most engineers can produce a reasonable solution to the problem in less than four hours.
3. **Show your work**. Committing your code regularly helps our reviewers understand your thought processes more clearly and prevents them from having to review large chunks of code in a vacuum.
4. **Don't sweat perfection**. This exercise is for you to demonstrate your coding and problem-solving abilities. We recognize that you may need more time to make the code as clean as possible or implement certain features the way you want to. Focus on prioritizing the most critical work first, and don't worry if you cannot get everything done. We are more interested in understanding your approach than in seeing perfect code.

## Code Review Guidelines
Once you've submitted your PR and notified our team, we will schedule a 45 - 60 minute walkthrough of your PR with members of our engineering team. Before the session, our team will have some time to review your PR and provide comments. These comments will form the basis of the kinds of questions they will ask you. The intent here is to allow you to share your design decisions with the team, learn about alternative approaches they may have, and build a rapport with your future teammates.

Code reviews are an essential part of how our teams work, and this exercise attempts to come as close to how we operate as possible.

## Alpha Vantage API
The project requires you to consume the Alpha Vantage Stock API. You will need a free API key which can be found at [https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key). Full API documentation can be found at [https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/).
